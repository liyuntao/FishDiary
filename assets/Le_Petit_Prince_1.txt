If you tell grown-ups, "I saw a beautiful red brick house, with geraniums at the window and doves on the roof...," they won't be able to imagine such a house. You have to tell them, "I saw a house worth a hundred thousand francs." Then they exclaim, "What a pretty house!"

如果你对大人们说：“我看到一幢用玫瑰色的砖盖成的漂亮房子，窗边有天竺葵，屋顶上还有鸽子……”他们怎么也想象不出房子的样子。但是如果对他们说：“我看见了一幢价值十万法郎的房子。”那么他们就惊呼：“多漂亮的房子啊！”


You know -- one loves the sunset, when one is so sad...

你知道的——当一个人情绪低落的时候，他会格外喜欢看日落...


If someone loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, "Somewhere, my flower is there..." But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened... And you think that is not important!

如果有人爱上了开在亿万星星上的一株花，那么看看星星就足以使他感到幸福。他对自己说，“我的那朵花就在其中某处...”但是羊若吃掉了花，对他来说仿佛所有的星星一下子全都消失了！这难道也不重要吗！
