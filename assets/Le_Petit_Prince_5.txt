The men where you live, raise five thousand roses in the same garden – and they do not find in it what they are looking for. And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water. But eyes are blind. One must look with the heart…

你所居住的星球上的人们，在同一座花园培育了五千朵玫瑰——却无法从中找到他们所要寻找的东西。但是，他们所寻找的，其实是可以从一朵玫瑰花或一滴水中找到的。然而眼睛往往是盲从的。人还是必须用心去看……


In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night… You – only you – will have stars that can laugh…

我就在繁星中的一颗上生活。我会站在其中的一颗星星上微笑。当你在夜间仰望天际时，就仿佛每一颗星星都在笑……你——只有你——才能拥有会笑的星星……


And when your sorrow is comforted time soothes all sorrows you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure… And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, "Yes, the stars always make me laugh!"

当你不再感到伤心的时候(时间会冲淡一切伤痛)，你就会因认识我而感到心满意足。你是我永远的朋友。将会和我一起欢笑。为了欢乐，你会经常打开窗子……当你的朋友看到你因仰望天空而大笑时，一定会感到莫名其妙！到时候，你可以对他们说：“是的，星星总让我开心而笑！”
