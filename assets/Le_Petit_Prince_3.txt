To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world.

对我而言，你只是一个小男孩，和其他成千上万的小男孩没有什么不同。我不需要你。你也不需要我。对你而言，我也和其它成千上万的狐狸并没有差别。但是，假如你驯服了我，我们就彼此需要了。对我而言，你就是举世无双的；对你而言，我也是独一无二的……


The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat.

麦田和我没有任何关联，真令人沮丧。不过，你有金黄色的头发。想想看，如果你驯服了我，那该有多好啊！小麦也是金黄色的，那会使我想起你。我会喜欢听麦田里的风声……


It is your own fault, I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you... but now you are going to cry! Then it has done you no good at all!

这是你的错，我根本无意伤害你，可是你却愿意让我驯服你……可是你现在却想哭！那驯服根本对你毫无好处！


It has done me good, because of the color of the wheat fields. Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world.

驯服对我是有好处的——因为麦田的颜色。再回头看那些玫瑰花吧！到时你就明白你的玫瑰花仍是举世无双的一朵花。
