"I shouldn't have listened to her", he confided to me one day. "You must never listen to flowers. You must look at them and smell them. Mine perfumed my planet, but I didn't know how to enjoy that. The business about the tiger claws, instead of annoying me, ought to have moved me..."

“我不该听她的呀，”一天他告诉我说，“花儿的话决不能听。花儿应该观赏、闻香的。我的花儿使整个星球飘香，可我却不会心旷神怡。关于虎爪的故事本该激起我的同情，却反而使我厌烦...”


And he confided further, "In those days, I didn't understand anything. I should have judged her according to her actions, nother words. She perfumed my planet and lit up my life. I should never have run away! I ought to have realized the tenderness underlying her silly. But I was too young to know how to love her."

他还告诉我说：
“我那时什么也不懂！判断她，本该凭所作所为，而不是凭花言巧语。她使我的星球吐芬芳，蓬荜增辉，我绝不该逃之夭夭的！我本该猜出她那站不住脚的花招后面的温情。花儿是多么自相矛盾！可我太小，不懂得如何去爱她...”


For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower…

她其实是不愿意让小王子看到自己哭泣。她曾经是多么高傲的一朵花……


My flower is ephemeral, and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left on my planet, all alone!

我的花生命是短暂的，她只有四根刺可以保护自己，抵御世界，我却将她独自留在我的星球上了！


I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose…

我总以为自己很富有，拥有一朵世上独一无二的花；实际上，我所拥有的不过是一朵普通的玫瑰而已。一朵普通的玫瑰花……
